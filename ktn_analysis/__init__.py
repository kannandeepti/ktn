""" Analysis of Kinetic Transition Networks (KTN)

The :py:mod:`ktn_analysis` package contains classes and modules to represent a
KTN in terms of its nodes and edges, and subsequently perform analyses on the
network, including coarsening the network into its most important nodes and
calculating steady state rate constants using NGT. The package also contains
scripts to construct model KTNs for user-specified potentials and node degree
distributions.
